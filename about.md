As a self-taught programmer, I learn best by doing. As a child I spent most of my time deconstructing and constructing any puzzle I could get my hands on. This early interest in solving problems has informed my career as an inspiring developer. I am mostly interested in building software for computers, websites, and occasionally tinkering with computer hardware and network components.

In my former life, I was a Chemistry graduate from the University at Buffalo. There I learned to think critically and analytically to solve complex problems. The allure for computer programming cultivated from the desire to create effective solutions. My decision to change careers stemmed from the need to understand why something work.

When I am not in my command line, you can either find me playing with puzzles, cooking, chasing my dog, or trying to learn the newest dance trends.
