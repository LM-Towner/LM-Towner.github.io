## Life after Dev Bootcamp (DBC)

So it's been about two weeks since I  finished Dev Bootcamp.
During phase 3 (which is the last 3 weeks of the program) I was counting down
the days, I couldn't wait to stop looking at the computer for 12+
hours and just relax. It turns out, I do not know how to relax. Relaxing scares
me, quiet scares me, and if I go a few hours without my computer I get a little
a "crazy".

During these last few months, I've grown an attachment to consistently working non-stop
until I drop and waking up and repeating again. DBC provided me with a structure
and all I had to do every day was show up do my chores for the day, get stuck in the
land of confusion, get found (hopefully), and create some awesome applications.

Now I'm on the other side of the grass, which I thought was greener, I'm finding
it harder to just accept that I no longer have the structure that was provided for me.
It is now my job to create "structure" and to continue to experience a
[growth mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means).

My first few days I tried to "relax", relaxing does not work for me. I can't allow
myself to just sit and do nothing. I decided that I'll set my day up as if I
was still attending DBC.

I start my day between 7 am & 9 am, I take my dog for a walk, go to the gym and
I try to dedicate at least 5 hours a day **actively learning**.
My plan of attack is to sharpen those skills I've learned at DBC while learning
something new.

So every day I log on to [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and pick a
track to focus on.

This week I am focusing on AJAX Basics and hoping to move on to Angular
before the end of the week. I want to get better at my frontend skills so that
I can become a well-balanced developer.
