&lt;p&gt;So it’s been about two weeks since I  finished Dev Bootcamp.
During phase 3 (which is the last 3 weeks of the program) I was counting down
the days, I couldn’t wait to stop looking at the computer for 12+
hours and just relax. It turns out, I do not know how to relax. Relaxing scares
me, quiet scares me, and if I go a few hours without my computer I get a little
a “crazy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During these last few months, I’ve grown an attachment to consistently working non-stop
until I drop and waking up and repeating again. DBC provided me with a structure
and all I had to do every day was show up do my chores for the day, get stuck in the
land of confusion, get found (hopefully), and create some awesome applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m on the other side of the grass, which I thought was greener, I’m finding
it harder to just accept that I no longer have the structure that was provided for me.
It is now my job to create “structure” and to continue to experience a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means&quot;&gt;growth mindset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first few days I tried to “relax”, relaxing does not work for me. I can’t allow
myself to just sit and do nothing. I decided that I’ll set my day up as if I
was still attending DBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start my day between 7 am &amp;amp; 9 am, I take my dog for a walk, go to the gym and
I try to dedicate at least 5 hours a day &lt;strong&gt;actively learning&lt;/strong&gt;.
My plan of attack is to sharpen those skills I’ve learned at DBC while learning
something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So every day I log on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com/&quot;&gt;Team Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; and pick a
track to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I am focusing on AJAX Basics and hoping to move on to Angular
before the end of the week. I want to get better at my frontend skills so that
I can become a well-balanced developer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>La-Keisha</name></author><summary type="html">Life after Dev Bootcamp (DBC)</summary></entry></feed>
