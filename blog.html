                        <p class="date">May 6, 2017</p></h2>
                      <p>In the last post, I discussed sharpening the skills
                         I learned at DBC. So what better way to do that
                          then to build a Ruby on Rails application.
                        From past experience in group projects, I have always
                         dealt with the backend portions of the application.
                         I have always done one or two things,
                       the database setup or the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html"> Route Setups</a>.
                        So with this project I wanted to expand and practice
                        on my front-end designing.

                        Some of my cohort-mates used
                        <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a>
                         in our past projects, which worked out great,
                         but since I wanted to mimic the way twitter looked
                         like I decided to use
                         <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
                           instead.

                        Using bootstrap wasn't as bad as I'd expected. It took
                        about an hour to familiarize myself with it's
                        documentation.And few more to actually use in a way that
                         made sense to what I was trying to do. Overall building
                        this social media  clone was good practice to exercise
                        my front-end skills. I look forward to working on future
                         projects using it and even exploring other frameworks.

                        random thought about the

                          <p class="date">April 28, 2017</p></h2>
                        <p>So it's been about two weeks since I finished Dev
                           Bootcamp. During phase 3 (which is the last 3 weeks
                           of the program)  I was counting down the days,
                           I couldn't wait to stop looking at the computer for
                            12+ hours and just relax. It turns out, I do not
                             know how to relax.Relaxing scares me, quiet scares
                             me, and if I go a few hours without my computer
                             I get a little a "crazy". During these last few
                              months,  I've grown an attachment to consistently
                               working non-stop until I drop and waking up and
                               repeating again. DBC provided me with a structure
                            and all I had to do every day was show up do my
                            chores for the day, get stuck in the land of
                             confusion, get found (hopefully), and create
                            some awesome applications.</p>
                        <p>Now I'm on the other side of the grass, which I
                          thought was greener, I'm finding it harder to just
                          accept that I no longer have the
                           structure that was provided for me.
                          It is now my job to create "structure" and to continue
                           to experience a
   <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means"> Growth Mindset</a>
                           I start my day between
                           7 &amp; 9 am, I take my dog for a walk, go to the gym
                          and I try to dedicate at
                         least 5 hours a day <strong>actively learning.</strong>
                    My plan of attack is to sharpen those skills I've learned at
                        DBC while learning something new. Every day I log on to
                <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/"> Team Treehouse</a>
                and pick a track to focus on.
                             My goal this week is to get better at my front-end
                             skills so that I can become a
                             well-balanced web developer</p>
