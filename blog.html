                        <h2>Life after Dev Bootcamp (DBC)</h2>

                      </header>
                        <p>April 28, 2017</p>

                        <p>So it's been about two weeks since I finished Dev Bootcamp. During phase 3 (which is the last 3 weeks of the program) I was counting down the days, I couldn't wait to stop looking at the computer for 12+ hours and just relax. It
                            turns out, I do not know how to relax. Relaxing scares me, quiet scares me, and if I go a few hours without my computer I get a little a "crazy".</p>

                        <p>During these last few months, I've grown an attachment to consistently working non-stop until I drop and waking up and repeating again. DBC provided me with a structure and all I had to do every day was show up do my chores for
                            the day, get stuck in the land of confusion, get found (hopefully), and create some awesome applications.</p>

                        <p>Now I'm on the other side of the grass, which I thought was greener, I'm finding it harder to just accept that I no longer have the structure that was provided for me. It is now my job to create "structure" and to continue to experience
                            a <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means"> Growth Mindset</a>

                            <p>I start my day between 7 am & 9 am, I take my dog for a walk, go to the gym and I try to dedicate at least 5 hours a day <strong>actively learning.</strong> My plan of attack is to sharpen those skills I've learned at DBC while
                                learning something new. Every day I log on to <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/"> Team Treehouse</a> and pick a track to focus on.</p>

                            <p> My goal this week is to get better at my front-end skills so that I can become a well-balanced web developer</p>
