                    <p class="date"> June 5, 2017</p>
                    <p>I spent the weekend at a Hackathon hosted by IBM. At first I didn't know what to expect but it was a
                        lot of fun. The event was from June 2, 2017 - June 4, 2017. On Friday was the general meet and greet
                        and formation of teams. I decided to form a team with familar faces and pitch and idea that I had
                        been working with solo. We decided to make an application for tackling that age old question "What
                        should we eat?"
                    </p>
                    <p>We spent the entire Saturday working alongside each other. We split the team up into two. We had the
                        front-end team(2pp) working on the UI design using React Native. I personally worked on the back-end,constructing
                        the server(expressjs), database(MongoDB) and supplying all the endpoints for the team. We had one
                        additional teammate who also flipped flopped in between the two teams to offer a fresh set of eyes
                        whenever one of us got stuck.
                    </p>
                    <p>On Sunday it was judgement time, we didn't feel comfortable with our app, but we had to present something.
                        I decided that since I had work so hard with the back-end I would try to at least try to win something.
                        To our surprise we actually won the prize of a "Best use of Loopback", which essentially a prize for my implentation of the back-end portion.
                        </p>
                        <p>Winning this prize was super affirming because it allowed me to pat myself on the back and see how much I had grown</p>

                    <p class="date">May 20,2017</p>
                    <p>Math Algorithms are my kryptonite. I knew coming into the tech industry that I'd eventually have to get
                        better at them. Most companies nowadays require you to perform some degree of these lovely problems.
                        However I want to clarify why they are my kryptonite, it’s not that I don’t like math. It’s quite
                        the opposite, I love math, I love puzzles, and I like brain teasers.But when presented with an algorithm
                        such as ‘find the sum of all primes below two million <a class=blog href='https://projecteuler.net/problem=10'>Project Euler</a>                        I find myself wondering why would I ever want to do that? I personally love real world problems and
                        solving things dealing with real life applications. If you want to fully gauge how a person thinks
                        give them creative range to solve a problem. For me these math algorithms place you in a box to only
                        solve it a few ways. Of course there are many ways to solve it , loops and methods etc. but at the
                        end of it all, it’s all the same.</p>
                    <p>Now with that said, all algorithms are not same. Algorithms are used to test how a person problem solves,
                        so I do, understand the necessary reason for using them. During my free time in the last few days,
                        even though I they are not my favorite, I’ve been on this website called project Euler working what
                        i’ve considered my weakness. According to the website each problem should only take you a few minutes
                        to figure it out. For me it takes about 30minutes or more to solve these problems. I think the reasoning
                        behind this is because I already told myself that I dislike these, problems. It’s really hard to
                        commit yourself when you’re already t old yourself you don’t want to do it.</p>
                    <p>My goal for this week is to do a few problems a day until I am comfortable with them, and then once I
                        am comfortable, I will try to go for speed. The first step was admitting that this is my weakness,
                        the next step is to conquer it.</p>

                    <p>I started doing some of these problems on
                        <a class="blog" href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler. </a> The biggest issue I find myself
                        is figuring out whether or not I want to use Ruby or Javascript. When I use Ruby I tend to run to
                        the built-in methods that do the harder work for you. Such as the
                        <a class="blog" href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html"> Enumerable</a> documentations
                        for solving problems that requiring adding or to aggregate a collection. When I use Javascript, I
                        find myself using less of built-in methods and trying to write it as cleanly as possible. When I
                        use JS, my code feels like it goes on for many lines whereas I can get to a simple solution with
                        Ruby in just a fewer lines. Before I type it up, I start of my solutions on a whiteboard or even
                        a notebook. I want to try to get into the habit of thinking it through without my text-editior yelling
                        at me about syntactic errors. Once I finish I upload and see if the problems works. So far, it's
                        only been a few syntactic errors but for the most part I have the general idea of how to solve the
                        problems.

                    </h2>
                    <p>In the last post, I discussed sharpening the skills I learned at DBC. So what better way to do that then
                        to build a Ruby on Rails application. From past experience in group projects, I have always dealt
                        with the backend portions of the application. I have always done one or two things, the database
                        setup or the <a class="blog" href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html"> Route Setups</a>.
                        So with this project I wanted to expand and practice on my front-end designing. Some of my cohort-mates
                        used
                        <a class="blog" href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a> in our past projects, which worked
                        out great, but since I wanted to mimic the way twitter looked like I decided to use
                        <a class="blog" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> instead. Using bootstrap wasn't as
                        bad as I'd expected. It took about an hour to familiarize myself with it's documentation. And few
                        more to actually use in a way that made sense to what I was trying to do. Overall building this social
                        media clone was good practice to exercise my front-end skills. I look forward to working on future
                        projects using it and even exploring other frameworks.

                    </h2>
                    <p>So it's been about two weeks since I finished Dev Bootcamp. During phase 3 (which is the last 3 weeks
                        of the program) I was counting down the days, I couldn't wait to stop looking at the computer for
                        12+ hours and just relax. It turns out, I do not know how to relax.Relaxing scares me, quiet scares
                        me, and if I go a few hours without my computer I get a little a "crazy". During these last few months,
                        I've grown an attachment to consistently working non-stop until I drop and waking up and repeating
                        again. DBC provided me with a structure and all I had to do every day was show up do my chores for
                        the day, get stuck in the land of confusion, get found (hopefully), and create some awesome applications.</p>
                    <p>Now I'm on the other side of the grass, which I thought was greener, I'm finding it harder to just accept
                        that I no longer have the structure that was provided for me. It is now my job to create "structure"
                        and to continue to experience a

                        at least 5 hours a day <strong>actively learning.</strong> My plan of attack is to sharpen those
                        skills I've learned at DBC while learning something new. Every day I log on to
                        <a class="blog" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/"> Team Treehouse</a> and pick a track to focus on.
                        My goal this week is to get better at my front-end skills so that I can become a well-balanced web
                        developer
