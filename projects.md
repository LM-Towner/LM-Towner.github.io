### DJ-Mood

DJ MOOD is an application that takes a short, 3-second video of the user's face, analyzes the emotions it is displaying,
and uses those emotions to generate a playlist from Spotify.
You will need a Spotify Account and a working web-cam for this application to work

### Technologies Used

DJ MOOD is built out of pure Javascript.
The back end runs on an Express.js and Node.js  which connects to a MongoDB database that stores user preferences.
The front end views are built with the Pug view engine.

### Timeline

This project was built in six days amongst four teammates

### Responsibilities

1) Learning how to use MongoDB and fully connecting it to the Express Server to gather information from the users

2) Setting up OAuth from Spotify

3) Learning how to use Pug Templating for the front-end views on the Website

4) Mocha and Chai testing for the Routes
